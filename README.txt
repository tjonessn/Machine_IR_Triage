This script collects a series of diagnostic and other information useful for triage of a compromised machine.

Script must be run from C directory in order for the memory capture to work
Move the folder "Machine_IR_Triage" to C:\

The memory capture uses a 3rd party tool called "comae" to take the memory dump.  Specifically it uses the dumpit.exe function.
This tool is open source and can be found here: https://www.comae.com/

All logs are exported to C:\StratNet_Triage
